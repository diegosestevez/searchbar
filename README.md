# Harry Potter Searchbar App
A very simple search bar application that filters results based on what the user types into the search bar. Results filter based on whether characters from the string that the user types is contained within either the character's name or the house they belong to. This application fetches data from the [harry potter API](https://hp-api.herokuapp.com/api/characters).
